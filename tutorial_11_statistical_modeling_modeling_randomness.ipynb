      "\n",
      "One of the most surprizing outcomes of the revolution in computing technology has been the discovery of diverse uses for randomness in the analysis of data and in science generally. Most young people have little trouble with the idea of a computer generating random data; they see it in computer games and simulations. Older people, raised with the idea that computers do mathematical operations and that such operations are completely deterministic, sometimes find computer-generated random numbers suspect. Indeed, conventional algebraic notation ($+$, $-$, $\\sqrt{}$, $\\cos{}$, and so on) has no notation for \"generated at random\".\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the simplest operators for generating random events is `numpy.random.choice`. This takes several arguments: the first being a set of items (`a`) to choose from, and the second being the number of events (`size`) to generate. Each item is equally likely to be chosen. For example, here is a simulation of a coin flip:"
