      "This tutorial presents two ways of doing hypothesis tests on whole models: 1) permutation tests where the connection is severed between the explanatory and response variables, and 2) tests such as ANOVA where the sampling distribution is calculated from first principals. In practice, first-principle tests are used most of the time. Still, the permutation test is useful for developing intuition about hypothesis testing - our main purpose here - and for those not-so-rare occaisons where the assumptions behind the first-principle tests as dubious."

      "The idea of a permutation test is to enfore the null hypothesis that there is no connection between the response variables and the explanatory variables. An effective way to do this is to randomize the response variable in a way that is consistent with sampling variability. When constructing confidence intervals, re-sampling was used. Re-sampling will typically repeat some cases and omit others. Here, we are more interested in scrambling the order of one or more variables while leaving the others in their original state. The `shuffle` function from the `numpy.random` module will be used to accomplish this.\n",
