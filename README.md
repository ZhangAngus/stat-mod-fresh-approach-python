Statistical Modeling: A Fresh Approach using Python
==============================

Python examples and code to replicate the R analysis used in the Computational Technique sections of each chapter from [Statistical Modeling: A Fresh Approach (2nd Edition)][book]

# A Fresh Approach for Python

The goal of this series of tutorials is to show how all of the R analysis and
commands used in the 'Computational Technique' sections of each chapter from
['Statistical Modeling: A Fresh Approach (2nd Edition)'][book] can be done just
as easily using the [Python][python] programming language. This has the dual
goal of introducing 'Scientific Python' to students learning statistics, as well
as showcasing the recent advances in statistical computing that have been
introduced to Python in recent years. Each tutorial in the series will cover the
Computational Technique section of a different chapter from the book, starting
with Section 1.4.3 from the introduction.
