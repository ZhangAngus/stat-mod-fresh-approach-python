      "Data used in statistical modeling are usually organized into tables, often created using spreadsheet software. Most people presume that the same software used to create a table of data should be used to display and analyze it. This is part of the reason for the popularity of spreadsheet programs such as 'Excel' and 'Google Spreadsheets'.\n",

      "For serious statistical work, it's helpful to take another approach that strictly separates the processes of data collection and of data analysis: use one program to create data \ufb01les and another program to analyze the data stored in those \ufb01les. By doing this, one guarantees that the original data are not modi\ufb01ed accidentally in the process of analyzing them. This also makes it possible to perform many di\ufb00erent analyses of the data; modelers often create and compare many di\ufb00erent models of the same data."

These vary depending on how the data are stored, where they are located, etc. To help keep things as simple as possible, the 'pandas' Python library iprovides an operator, `read_csv()` that allows you to access data \ufb01les in tabular format on your computer as well as data stored in repositories such as the one associated with the 'Statistical Modeling: A Fresh Approach' book, or one that a course instructor might set up for his or her students.\n",
